# sfdx-nix

Simple NixOS flake that provides the [SFDX CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli).

I hacked this together with `node2nix`, it may not be ideal!

This project is in no way affiliated with Salesforce.

This project's license only covers the code in this repository, and is licensed
under the same license that the SFDX CLI itself is.
